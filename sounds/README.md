# Sound Files for Rubber Duck's Cloudy Adventure

This directory should contain the following sound files for the game:

## Required Sound Files

1. `quack.mp3` - Duck quacking sound
2. `water_ambient.mp3` - Ambient water sounds for the pond scene
3. `success.mp3` - Success sound for completing activities
4. `cloudPop.mp3` - Sound for when clouds are tapped
5. `rain.mp3` - Rain ambient sound for the rain scene
6. `number1.mp3` through `number5.mp3` - Voice narration for numbers 1-5

## Sound File Sources

For the actual implementation, you would need to:

1. Create or record these sound files
2. Purchase sound effects from a stock audio site
3. Use royalty-free sound effects from sites like:
   - [Freesound](https://freesound.org/)
   - [SoundBible](http://soundbible.com/)
   - [ZapSplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/)

## Implementation Note

In a production environment, these sound files would be actual audio files in formats like MP3, WAV, or OGG. For this prototype, you'll need to add the actual sound files to this directory before the audio features will work correctly.
